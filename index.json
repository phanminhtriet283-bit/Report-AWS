Success requires integrating AI into strategy, culture, and core capabilities. Apply product thinking to AI: measure, iterate, and scale. Data is the foundation of every AI initiative Unified, high-quality, well-governed data determines AI effectiveness. Standardize metadata, lineage, sensitivity classification, and role-based access. Treat data as a strategic asset, not just technical input. Security and responsibility enable sustainable AI Security-by-design: encryption, data domain separation, and least privilege. Control model inputs/outputs, filter content, and trace requests and decisions. Transparency, fairness, and regulatory compliance are baseline requirements for modern AI deployments. Applying at Work Launch GenAI POCs with clear objectives (content generation, knowledge search, business assistants) Standardize data catalogs, establish lineage, and role-based access policies Embed security/privacy controls directly into build and run pipelines Adopt an “AI-by-default” mindset for automatable workflows Set up an AI/ML CoE, implementation playbooks, and security checklists Train teams on prompt engineering, output evaluation, and AI ethics Build a prioritized use case backlog by value vs complexity Event Experience Attending AWS Cloud Day 2025 gave me a clear pathway to bring AI into the organization: start with trustworthy data, set explicit business value metrics, then progressively raise levels of automation. What struck me most was how leading organizations balance experimentation speed with operational discipline. I left with a practical action list and strong motivation to drive change within the team.\nBroader View of Technology and Trends Recognize the pivotal role of data – GenAI – security in strategy. See AWS’s priorities in Vietnam and the region around AI, modernization, and security. Understand the picture from strategy to operations, not just isolated technologies. Connect and Learn from Experts Hear cross-industry case studies from banking, tech, and startups. Exchange directly with architects, leaders, and practitioner communities. Expand networks for collaboration and real-world implementation sharing. New Mindset for Application Embed AI into daily workflows instead of scattered pilots. Establish a solid data foundation before “burning” budget on large models. Make security, privacy, and compliance design criteria from the start. Inspired to Innovate Embrace the spirit of “Think Big, Build Smart, Ship Secure”. Accelerate learning, controlled experimentation, and internal sharing. Commit to practical, measurable digital and AI transformation. Lessons learned AI delivers sustainable value only when tightly connected to strategy, standardized data, and disciplined security. Organizations must be flexible in experimentation yet rigorous in operations to scale without losing control. The clear path: trustworthy data → KPI-backed use cases → robust guardrails → staged automation.\nSome Photos "

	"content": "Introduction to Amazon Bedrock Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed platform that provides access to a wide range of powerful large language models (LLMs). It enables applications to interact with AI models through simple API calls without the need to deploy or manage machine learning infrastructure. Bedrock supports a variety of foundation models such as Claude, Llama, and Titan, making it suitable for tasks like text generation, question-answering, content summarization, and other AI-driven use cases. In a serverless architecture, Bedrock can be integrated directly with AWS Lambda to build lightweight, scalable, and easily maintained AI services. Workshop Overview In this workshop, you will build a simple question-and-answer service using Amazon Bedrock. When a user submits a query, a Lambda function will construct a prompt, send it to a Bedrock model, and return the generated response.\nTo support this workflow, the workshop makes use of three core components:\nLambda function – acts as the processing layer, receiving input and invoking Bedrock’s API. Amazon Bedrock Runtime – performs the inference based on the selected model. API Gateway (optional) – exposes an HTTP endpoint for external clients or users to send their questions. The high-level workflow of the system is as follows:\nA user sends a question through API Gateway. API Gateway forwards the request to the Lambda function. Lambda invokes Amazon Bedrock with the constructed prompt. Bedrock returns the generated model output. Lambda formats and returns the response to the client. The diagram below illustrates the overall architecture used in this workshop:\n"

Cleanup \u0026amp; Cost Optimization:\nDeleted test objects, disabled Transfer Acceleration and CloudFront (if used). Deleted unused test buckets to prevent additional charges. Compiled best practices for cost and security: Avoid public buckets entirely. Use Versioning + Lifecycle Rules for recovery and cost reduction. Use S3 Storage Lens and CloudWatch Budgets to monitor and control costs. Notes: Never make the entire bucket public; use Bucket Policy to expose only specific objects. Enable Block Public Access at the account level by default. Use Versioning + Lifecycle Rules to prevent data loss and reduce cost. Use CloudFront or Amplify Hosting for HTTPS, CDN, and modern static site deployment. Monitor costs using CloudWatch and S3 Storage Lens. Delete carefully when Versioning is enabled—remove all versions and delete markers before deleting a bucket. Summary of Knowledge Gained: Operate Amazon S3 at a production level: hosting, security, cost optimization, versioning, and replication. Choose the right tool for static website hosting: Amplify (recommended), CloudFront + S3, or S3 only for simplicity. Perform large-scale data management: object transfer, cross-region replication, and automation with Lifecycle Rules. Clean up resources properly to avoid unexpected costs. "

	"content": "AWS for SAP\nAgentic AI Assistant for SAP with AWS Generative AI Written by Sourav Sadhu on September 4, 2025 in Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Bedrock Agents, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, SAP on AWS, Technical How-to Permalink Share\nIntroduction\nSAP systems are the backbone of many enterprises, managing critical business processes and generating large volumes of high-value data. These critical business processes and data often extend beyond the core enterprise SAP systems, requiring customers to interact with external systems. As organizations look to leverage this data for deeper insights and improved decision-making, there is a growing need to transform how SAP customers interact with their data and systems.\nThe natural language processing (NLP) capabilities of generative AI provide SAP users with a powerful tool to interact with complex ERP systems using natural language questions, eliminating the need for deep technical knowledge or complex SQL queries. This democratizes data access across the organization, enabling business users to ask questions, generate reports, and gather real-time insights through conversational interfaces.\nIntegrating generative AI with SAP systems enables organizations to bridge the gap between structured ERP data and unstructured information from SAP and non-SAP sources, providing a more holistic view of their business context. This integration can lead to more accurate forecasting, personalized customer experiences, and data-driven decisions that span the entire enterprise ecosystem.\nAWS and SAP empower customers at every stage of their generative AI adoption journey with a rich portfolio of advanced generative AI services, robust infrastructure, and implementation resources. These services integrate with SAP systems and complement the broader cloud service ecosystems of both AWS and SAP.\nIn this blog post (Part 1 of a 2-part series), I will describe and demonstrate how you can leverage Amazon Bedrock and other AWS services to derive insights from SAP and non-SAP data sources using human natural language through a unified interface exposed via MS Teams, Slack, and a Streamlit UI.\nIn Part 2 of this blog series, I will describe and demonstrate how you can leverage SAP BTP services [SAP Build Apps, SAP Generative AI Hub] to derive insights from SAP and non-SAP systems using natural language via a unified interface using SAP Build Apps as the front-end UI.\nOverview\nI will start by developing the business logic required to extract data from the SAP system. I will create two AWS Lambda functions to execute the business logic, supported by various AWS services including Bedrock Knowledge Bases and AWS Secrets Manager. I will then focus on creating the business logic to process data from an additional non-SAP data source by deploying another Lambda function that is designed specifically to extract data from Amazon DynamoDB, where logistics information is stored. To enhance the system’s capabilities, I will set up a knowledge base that will act as a third data source, supporting general user queries. Next, I will deploy an Amazon Bedrock Agent responsible for orchestrating the flow between the different data sources based on the user’s query. In the final stage, I will build a user interface using Streamlit, while also providing an alternative integration option with MS Teams and Slack to increase accessibility.\nFigure 1. High-level architecture\nImplementation guide\nI have structured the solution into 5 steps. Let’s walk through each step:\nStep 1 – Create business logic to fetch data from the SAP system\nStep 2 – Create business logic to fetch data from the non-SAP system\nStep 3 – Create Bedrock knowledge bases for general queries\nStep 4 – Create Bedrock Agents to orchestrate between different data sources\nStep 5 – Build user interfaces with Microsoft Teams, Slack, and Streamlit\nPrerequisites\nAn AWS account with appropriate IAM permissions to work with Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, Amazon Bedrock Agents, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, Amazon Bedrock LLM (Claude), AWS Secrets Manager, and Amazon DynamoDB. If you are new to these services, you should review them before proceeding.\nAn SAP system that supports SAP OData services as the data source for SAP Sales Orders. I have used the standard OData service SAP Sales Order Service: API_SALES_ORDER_SRV and the Entity Set A_SalesOrder for this demo. However, you can use any OData service depending on your use case. I have exposed the OData service over the internet, but depending on where your SAP system is hosted, you may choose not to expose it over the internet. We recommend setting up a private connection for better performance and security. For more information, see How to enable OData services in SAP S/4HANA and Connecting to RISE from your AWS account. A Slack account for Slack integration and an MS Teams account for MS Teams integration [optional]. Step 1 – Create business logic to fetch data from the SAP system\nI. I will start by creating a secret in AWS Secrets Manager to store the credentials and connection details of the S4 system.\nChoose the secret type Other type of secret and then add the following details in the Key/Value pairs. Set the secret values specific to your environment.\nSecret key Secret value S4_host_details https://\u0026lt;hostname\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;port\u0026gt; S4_username xxxx S4_password xxxx For more information, see Create a secret in AWS Secrets Manager.\nII. As the second step, I will create two Bedrock knowledge bases to supplement and support SAP data when required.\nOdata-Schema-knowledgebase: I will use this knowledge base to provide schema details to the LLM, so that the model has sufficient knowledge of which attributes to use when constructing the OData URL based on the user’s query. SAP-external-knowledgebase: I will use this knowledge base to provide additional details for non-SAP data. I considered the following inputs when creating the two knowledge bases, with all other settings kept at their default values.\nProvide knowledge base details Knowledge base name: Choose a name for each knowledge base with a user-friendly description. I used Odata-Schema-knowledgebase and SAP-external-knowledgebase. Knowledge base description: Provide a description that uniquely identifies your knowledge base. IAM permissions: Choose Create and use a new service role. Data source configuration Data source: Choose Amazon S3. Data source name: Choose a name for each data source. S3 URI: Create two S3 buckets, one for each knowledge base. Upload the file Sales_Order_Schema.json for Odata-Schema-knowledgebase and Shipping_Policy.pdf for SAP-external-knowledgebase from the GitHub repository to the corresponding S3 buckets and provide the S3 URIs. Storage and data handling configuration Embeddings model: Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2. Vector database: For Vector creation method, choose Create a new vector store quickly, and use Amazon OpenSearch Serverless as the vector store. For more information, see Create a knowledge base by connecting to a data source in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.\nThis is my final view\nIII. Now, I will create two Lambda functions to extract data from the SAP system based on the user’s query.\nSAP-Odata-URL-Generation: This Lambda function executes the business logic to generate an OData URL based on the user’s query using the LLM, supplemented by schema details from the knowledge base and host details from AWS Secrets Manager. SAP-Sales-Order-Query: This Lambda function executes the core business logic to retrieve data from the SAP system. It uses the OData URL provided by the SAP-Odata-URL-Generation function and securely accesses the system credentials stored in AWS Secrets Manager. The function then processes the retrieved data, leveraging the LLM through Bedrock, and finally presents structured information back to the Bedrock Agent for further use. I considered the following inputs when creating the Lambda functions, keeping all other settings at their default values.\nChoose Author from scratch. Function name: Choose a name for each function with a user-friendly description. I selected SAP-Odata-URL-Generation and SAP-Sales-Order-Query. Runtime: Python 3.13. Architecture: x86_64. Code: Copy the code from SAP-Odata-URL-Generation.py for the SAP-Odata-URL-Generation function and SAP-Sales-Order-Query.py for the SAP-Sales-Order-Query function from the GitHub repository. Note: Adjust the code with deployment-specific values such as kb_id, SecretId, and so on. Configuration: Memory: 1024 MB, Timeout: 15 minutes. Layers: Add the requests-layer.zip layer from the GitHub repository to include the requests module in the Lambda function. Permissions: The following permissions need to be configured for the Lambda functions. SAP-Odata-URL-Generation: Execution role – In addition to the basic Lambda execution role, create a new IAM policy with the following actions: bedrock:InvokeModel, bedrock-agent-runtime:Retrieve, secretsmanager:GetSecretValue. Resource-based policy – lambda:InvokeFunction permission for the ARN of the Bedrock Agent that we will create in Step 4. SAP-Sales-Order-Query: Execution role – In addition to the basic Lambda execution role, create a new IAM policy with the following actions: bedrock:InvokeModel, secretsmanager:GetSecretValue. Resource-based policy – lambda:InvokeFunction permission for the ARN of the Bedrock Agent that we will create in Step 4. For more information, see Building Lambda functions with Python and Working with Lambda layers for Python functions.\nStep 2 – Create business logic to fetch data from the non-SAP system\nI. I will start by creating a DynamoDB table with the following inputs:\nTable name: logistics Partition key: order_id Use the Items.json file from the GitHub repository to create items in the DynamoDB table. For more information, see Creating Amazon DynamoDB table items from a JSON file.\nII. Now, I will create a Lambda function to extract data from the DynamoDB table based on the user’s query.\nChoose Author from scratch. Function name: Choose a name for the function with a user-friendly description. I chose Logistics-System. Runtime: Python 3.13. Architecture: x86_64. Configuration: Memory: 1024 MB, Timeout: 15 minutes. Code: Copy the code from Logistics-System.py from the GitHub repository. Permissions: Add the following permissions to the Lambda function. Execution role – In addition to the basic Lambda execution role, create a new IAM policy with the following actions: dynamodb:Query, dynamodb:DescribeTable. Resource-based policy – lambda:InvokeFunction permission for the ARN of the Bedrock Agent that we will create in Step 4. Step 3 – Create a knowledge base for general queries\nNow, I will create a third knowledge base. This knowledge base will act as a general information repository. Users can access this resource to learn about different topics, from organizational information to topic-specific expertise, depending on their needs.\nGeneral-information-knowledgebase: In this demo, I will use this knowledge base to provide guidance on SAP business processes.\nI considered the following inputs when creating the knowledge base, keeping the rest of the settings at their default values.\nProvide knowledge base details Knowledge base name: Choose a name for the knowledge base. I used General-information-knowledgebase with a user-friendly description. IAM permissions: Choose Create and use a new service role. Data source configuration Data source: Choose Amazon S3. Data source name: Choose any name for the data source. S3 URI: Create an S3 bucket, upload the file “How to create SAP Sales Order pdf” from the GitHub repository, and provide the corresponding S3 URI. Storage and data handling configuration Embeddings model: Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2. Vector database: For Vector creation method, choose Create a new vector store quickly and use Amazon OpenSearch Serverless as the vector store. This is my final view\nStep 4 – Create a Bedrock Agent\nIn this step, I will create a Bedrock Agent to help orchestrate between the different data sources that we have created in the previous steps in order to answer user queries.\nI considered the following inputs when creating the Bedrock Agent, keeping all other settings at their default values.\nAgent details: Agent name: Choose a name and a user-friendly description for the agent. I named it Business-Query-System. Agent resource role: Choose Create and use a new service role. Choose model: Select Claude 3 Sonnet v1. You may choose another LLM, but you will need to adjust the prompts accordingly to achieve the desired responses. Instructions for the Agent: Provide detailed, step-by-step instructions clearly describing what you want the Agent to do. You are an AI assistant that helps users query SAP sales data directly from the SAP system and shipping details from the logistics system. You also help users with general business process queries using the company knowledge bases.\nAdditional settings: Enable User input.\nAction groups: Action groups define the tasks the agent should help the user perform.\nAction group: SAP-Sales-Order – I will use this action group to handle any query related to SAP sales orders. Action group name: Choose a name and provide a user-friendly description. I used SAP-Sales-Order. Action group type: Defined by function details. Invocation method: Choose Use an existing Lambda function and select the Lambda function created in Step 1, SAP-Sales-Order-Query. Action function name 1: SalesOrder and provide a description for the function. Action group: Logistics-System – I will use this action group to handle any query related to logistics information for sales orders. Action group name: Choose a name and provide a user-friendly description. I used Logistics-System. Action group type: Defined by API schema. Invocation method: Choose Use an existing Lambda function and select the Lambda function created in Step 2, Logistics-System. Action group schema: Choose an existing API schema. S3 URL: Create an S3 bucket, upload the logistics.json file from the GitHub repository to the S3 bucket, and provide the S3 URL. Memory: Choose Enabled with a memory time of 2 days and a maximum of 20 recent sessions.\nKnowledge bases: Add the previously created knowledge bases.\nSelect knowledge base: SAP-external-knowledgebase. Knowledge base instructions for the Agent: Use this knowledge base when you need information external to the SAP system and combine it with SAP system data to complete your response.\nSelect knowledge base: General-information-knowledgebase. Knowledge base instructions for the Agent: Use this knowledge base to answer general business questions from the user that are not directly available from the SAP system.\nOrchestration configuration – Default orchestration. Bedrock Agents provide default prompt templates, but these can be customized to meet specific requirements. I will customize the following prompt templates to fit our use case.\nPre-processing: Choose Override default pre-processing template. Add the following section to the prompt template: Category F: Questions that can be answered or supported by the agent calling our function-based tools using the provided functions and arguments from the conversation history or relevant arguments gathered using the askuser function AND also require external data from the knowledge bases to complete the response. Combine data from the SAP system or the non-SAP Logistics system and the external knowledge base to prepare the final answer. Orchestration: Choose Override default orchestration template. Add the following text to the corresponding sections in the prompt template.\n$knowledge_base_guideline$\nIf any data such as the delivery date is not updated in the Logistics system, then check the knowledge base named SAP-external-knowledgebase to find the estimated delivery time based on the shipping category. Then, take that duration and add it to the “Order Received” date and share the estimated delivery date with the user.\nIf the SAP system returns an error because the requested data is not available, check the knowledge base named SAP-external-knowledgebase for the explanation of the ERROR CODE. Respond to the user only with the explanation of the error code.\n$tools_guidelines$ [This section does not exist by default; we need to create it]\nCall the SAP-Sales-Order tool only for any questions related to sales orders.\nCall the Logistics-System tool only for any shipping details for sales orders.\nDO NOT call both tools SAP-Sales-Order and Logistics-System unless the user explicitly asks for both pieces of information.\n$multiple_tools_guidelines$ [This section does not exist by default; we need to create it]\nIf the user’s question requires calling more than one tool, call the tools one by one. Collect the responses from both tools and then combine them before replying to the user. For example, if the user asks for both Sales Order and Logistics information, first fetch the Sales Order details using the Sales Order tool. Then, fetch the logistics details using the Logistics tool. Finally, combine both responses into one when responding to the user.\nAfter entering all the details, I will choose Save, and then choose Prepare to update the agent with the latest changes. To navigate to the agent dashboard, select Save and exit.\nFinally, create an Alias to have a specific snapshot or version of the agent that will be used by applications.\nChoose Create alias, provide an alias name with a user-friendly description.\nChoose Create new version and link it with this alias for a version with default On-demand throughput.\nFor more information, see Create and configure an agent manually.\nThis is my final view\nNow, I need to adjust the IAM roles for the Lambda functions so that the Bedrock Agent can invoke them.\nFollow the steps in Using resource-based policies for Lambda and attach the following resource-based policy to the Lambda function to allow Amazon Bedrock to access the Lambda function for the agent’s action groups, replacing the ${values} as needed.\nJSON\n{\r\u0026quot;Version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;2012-10-17\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;Statement\u0026quot;: [\r{\r\u0026quot;Sid\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;AccessLambdaFunction\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;Effect\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Allow\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;Principal\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;Service\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;bedrock.amazonaws.com\u0026quot;\r},\r\u0026quot;Action\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;lambda:InvokeFunction\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;Resource\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;arn:aws:lambda:${region}:${account-id}:function:function-name\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;Condition\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;StringEquals\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;AWS:SourceAccount\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;${account-id}\u0026quot;\r},\r\u0026quot;ArnLike\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;AWS:SourceArn\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;arn:aws:bedrock:${region}:${account-id}:agent/${agent-id}\u0026quot;\r}\r}\r}\r]\r}\rThis is my policy\n{\r\u0026quot;Version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;2012-10-17\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;Id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;default\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;Statement\u0026quot;: [\r{\r\u0026quot;Sid\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;bedrock-agent-sales\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;Effect\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Allow\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;Principal\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;Service\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;bedrock.amazonaws.com\u0026quot;\r},\r\u0026quot;Action\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;lambda:InvokeFunction\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;Resource\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:1234567xxxx:function:SAP-Sales-Order-Query\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;Condition\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;StringEquals\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;AWS:SourceAccount\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1234567xxxx\u0026quot;\r},\r\u0026quot;AWS:SourceArn\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1: 1234567xxxx:agent/VX5FAWE3OO\u0026quot;\r}\r}\r}\r]\r}\rStep 5 – Build user interfaces with Microsoft Teams, Slack, and Streamlit\nThis step involves developing user interfaces that allow users to interact with the Bedrock Agent.\nMicrosoft Teams – This integration requires access to MS Teams (with the appropriate permissions) and Amazon Q Developer in the chat application. Amazon Q Developer in the chat application (formerly AWS Chatbot) allows you to interact with Bedrock GenAI Agents within Microsoft Teams. Step 1: Configure app access\nMicrosoft Teams must be installed and approved by your organization’s administrator.\nStep 2: Configure the Teams channel\nCreate a standard MS Teams channel or use an existing channel and add Amazon Q Developer to the channel. [Note: A standard channel is required because Microsoft Teams currently does not support Amazon Q Developer in private channels.]\nIn Microsoft Teams, find and select your team name, then choose Manage team. Select Apps, then choose Add app. Enter Amazon Q Developer in the search bar to find the app. Select the bot. Choose Add to a team and complete the prompts.

	"content": "Preparation Steps Before Starting Before building your AI API using Lambda + Bedrock, you need to configure several AWS resources and permissions.\n1. Choose an AWS Region that Supports Bedrock Amazon Bedrock is available in several AWS regions.\nFor this workshop, you may choose:\nus-east-1 (N. Virginia) – commonly used in AWS documentation ap-southeast-1 (Singapore) – also supports Bedrock and works normally Just make sure the model you want to use (Claude, Llama, Mistral…) is available in that region.\n2. Create an IAM Role for Lambda Lambda needs an IAM Role to call Bedrock models and write logs to CloudWatch.\nIn this section, you will first create a custom policy, then create a role and attach the policy.\n🔹 Step 1 — Create a New Policy Open IAM Console → Policies → Create policy In the “Specify permissions” page, select the JSON tab.\nDelete all existing content and replace it with the following: { \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;bedrock:InvokeModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;logs:CreateLogGroup\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;logs:CreateLogStream\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;logs:PutLogEvents\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; } ] } Click Next, give the policy a name (e.g., lambda-bedrock) and click Create policy. 🔹 Step 2 — Create the IAM Role and Attach the Policy Go to IAM Console → Roles → Create role Select: Trusted entity type: AWS service Use case: Lambda In “Add permissions”, search for the policy you created earlier (lambda-bedrock) and select it. Name your role, for example: lambda-bedrock-role Then click Create role.\nYour Lambda execution role is now ready with the minimum permissions required to call Amazon Bedrock and write CloudWatch logs.\n3. Verify the Model Using Bedrock Playground Before writing Lambda code to call the Converse API, test the model in the AWS Console.\n🔹 Step 1 — Open the Model Catalog Open Amazon Bedrock → Model catalog 🔹 Step 2 — Choose a Model and Open Playground Pick a model such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1, or Mistral 24.07 Click Open in playground 🔹 Step 3 — Send a Test Prompt Enter a simple question to confirm the model is responding correctly in your selected region.\n🔹 Step 4 — (Optional) Check if the Model Supports the Converse API If you want to confirm whether the selected model supports Converse API, follow these steps:\nReturn to the model page in the catalog Scroll down to Code examples AWS will open an example code page. If the model supports Converse API, the example will include:\nbedrock.converse(...) Like this:\n4. Recommended (Optional) Knowledge You may find it helpful to know the following:\nBasics of AWS Lambda How to create an HTTP API with API Gateway How to view logs in CloudWatch This workshop is beginner-friendly and does not require deep AWS experience.\nIn the next step, you will create a Lambda function and write your first code snippet to call the Converse API in Amazon Bedrock.\n"

	"content": "FitAI Challenge An application that helps users lose weight through exercise challenges, integrated with AI for tracking and evaluation 1. Executive Summary FitAI Challenge is a website developed for Vietnamese users, aiming to promote fitness and exercise culture through sports challenges that incorporate gamification and artificial intelligence (AI). The website uses an AI Camera to recognize and count exercise movements such as push-ups, squats, planks, and jumping jacks, while also analyzing posture to provide accurate evaluations. Users can participate in individual challenges to earn FitPoints upon completing tasks, which can be redeemed for vouchers, gifts, or discounts from partner merchants. FitAI Challenge targets students, young adults, and working professionals — individuals who need motivation to maintain regular workout habits amid their busy lives.\n2. Problem Statement What’s the Problem? In Vietnam, most existing fitness applications primarily focus on basic guidance or step counting, and there is currently no platform that combines AI-based motion recognition, gamification, and an online fitness challenge community. Users often lack motivation to exercise consistently and do not have tools that can accurately evaluate their workout performance. In addition, gyms and sports brands also lack creative engagement channels to connect with young and active customer groups.\nThe Solution FitAI Challenge uses an AI Camera to recognize, count, and evaluate the accuracy of workout movements through Computer Vision. All user workout data is stored and processed via AWS Cloud using a serverless architecture: AWS Lambda: processes AI data and backend requests. AWS S3: stores videos, images, and temporary results. The website is developed using React Native with a friendly and intuitive interface. Users can: Participate in individual, group, or nationwide challenges. Earn FitPoints upon completing exercises. Redeem FitPoints for vouchers or gifts from partners (Shopee, Grab, CGV, etc.). Track leaderboards and share achievements on social media.\nBenefits and Return on Investment For users: Create daily workout motivation through challenge and reward mechanisms. Receive transparent performance evaluations supported by AI. Connect with the fitness community through leaderboards and sharing feeds. For partner businesses: A branding channel associated with a healthy lifestyle. Access to a young, dynamic, and health-conscious customer base. For the development team: Establish a unique “Fitness + Gamification + E-commerce” business model in Vietnam. Serverless cloud architecture helps reduce operating costs and allows easy scalability. The MVP can be developed within the first 3 months with low infrastructure costs (estimated at 0.80 USD/month on AWS).\n3. Solution Architecture FitAI Challenge is an intelligent sports training platform that applies an AWS Serverless architecture combined with an AI/ML pipeline. The system’s goal is to record workout data, analyze performance, and generate AI-powered feedback to provide personalized coaching for users.

	"content": "Networking \u0026amp; Content Delivery Amazon CloudFront Now Supports IPv6 Origins for End-to-End IPv6 Delivery\nWritten by Sagar Desarda and Ravi Avula on 04 SEP 2025 in Best Practices, Networking \u0026amp; Content Delivery, Technical How-To Permalink Share\nIPv6 adoption continues to accelerate worldwide as organizations move beyond the limitations of IPv4 address space. At Amazon Web Services (AWS), we have long supported IPv6 from end users to the Amazon CloudFront network, helping end users reduce latency, improve performance, and expand reach across modern mobile networks. Today, we are excited to take another step forward. Starting today, CloudFront now supports IPv6 connectivity from edge to origin—enabling a truly end-to-end IPv6 delivery path. This allows end users to use CloudFront as a dual-stack IPv6 and IPv4 Internet gateway for their web applications to provide content acceleration.\nWhy is this important?\nIPv6 is the foundational transport protocol for most modern mobile networks and an increasing share of broadband traffic. Enabling IPv6 to the origin allows you to maintain consistency of protocol across the delivery chain, reduce operational costs from dual-stack complexity, and achieve more deterministic, observable, and efficient traffic flows. For CloudFront end users, these benefits translate directly into faster page loads, more stable streaming, and an architecture that continues to operate reliably as IPv4 resources deplete.\nBenefits of IPv6 for CloudFront-backed applications\nCloudFront now supports origins over IPv6, enabling end-to-end IPv6 connectivity from end users to your origin servers. This unlocks a wide range of technical and operational advantages over traditional IPv4-based delivery.\nEliminates NAT costs and improves performance\nIPv4 networks rely heavily on Network Address Translation (NAT), especially carrier-grade NAT used by ISPs and mobile operators. These NAT layers introduce delays during connection establishment, limit port availability, and can cause packet drops. IPv6 removes the need for NAT, enabling direct end-to-end connectivity between clients, CloudFront, and origin servers. This results in lower latency, faster page loads, and better user experience—especially in mobile-first markets with high IPv6 adoption.\nMore efficient packet processing\nIPv6 introduces simplified headers and fixed-length extension headers for optional control information. This makes packet parsing and forwarding more efficient for routers, firewalls, load balancers, and CloudFront nodes. IPv6 reduces per-packet processing overhead and eliminates ambiguity in forwarding or deep packet inspection systems. Unlike IPv4, which allows fragmentation along the routing path, IPv6 delegates all fragmentation responsibility to the source server. This architectural constraint improves transmission performance by reducing retransmissions and maintaining optimal segment sizes throughout the transport path. As a result, IPv6 enables more stable and efficient TCP connections, especially over long-haul or high-latency paths between CloudFront and origins.\nPredictable path control and congestion handling\nIPv6 enforces end-to-end Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD), fully delegating fragmentation responsibility to the source. This improves transmission predictability and minimizes risks of packet drops or fragmentation due to MTU mismatches. IPv6 improves TCP stability and throughput—especially across long-haul or high-latency paths between CloudFront and non-AWS origins—by reducing retransmissions and maintaining optimal segment sizes end-to-end.\nFor AWS origins, similar benefits are achieved today thanks to AWS backbone features like jumbo frame support. Enabling jumbo frames between AWS edge locations and application endpoints in AWS Regions allows CloudFront to send and receive larger payloads per packet. Jumbo frames reduce the total time required to transmit data between end users and your application.\nHigher connection scalability\nUnder IPv4, NAT reduces the number of available source ports per origin IP address, limiting the number of concurrent connections a CloudFront node can establish with an origin. This constraint can become problematic in high-traffic environments where thousands of concurrent requests must be handled efficiently. This is especially beneficial when using protocols like HTTP/2, where multiplexing multiple streams over a single connection and reusing connections is critical for maximizing performance and minimizing latency.\nGetting Started Beginning today, you can configure origins associated with your CloudFront distribution to use IPv6. The new feature allows you to choose between IPv4 (default), IPv6, or Dualstack (IPv4 and IPv6). For existing origins, CloudFront continues to use IPv4. When using Dualstack, CloudFront automatically selects between IPv4 and IPv6 to ensure even load distribution across both.\nYou can use the CloudFront console or CloudFront API to create or update your distribution to configure IPv6 connectivity with your origin. In this post, we guide you through creating an IPv6-enabled origin and explore best practices for safely enabling IPv6 on existing origins. Before starting, ensure that your origin supports IPv6 or dual-stack connectivity. This may be a custom origin or an AWS service that supports IPv6, such as Elastic Load Balancers, Amazon API Gateway, or AWS Lambda Function URLs.\nCreating a new CloudFront distribution with an IPv6 origin In the CloudFront console, choose the option to create a CloudFront distribution.\nStep 1: Begin Enter the distribution name and any other optional parameters before selecting Next to proceed to Step 2.\nStep 2: Specify the origin In Step 2, select the origin type and enter origin information. To configure IPv6, choose custom origin settings in the Settings panel.\nSelect IPv6 or Dualstack for the Origin IP Address Type and choose Next.\nStep 3: Enable security You may choose to enable AWS WAF to protect your application and select Next.\nStep 4: Review and create Review and select Create distribution to create the distribution.\nAdding a new IPv6 origin to an existing CloudFront distribution To add a new IPv6 origin to an existing CloudFront distribution, open the Distribution settings by selecting the distribution and choosing the Origins tab to Create origin.\nExpand the Additional settings panel and choose the IPv6 or Dualstack option for the Origin IP Address Type to enable IPv6 connectivity. When you create the origin, add or update cache behaviors to point to your new origin.\nEnabling IPv6 for an existing origin You can use CloudFront continuous deployment to safely roll out changes to origin settings. Continuous deployment allows you to test changes safely using a deployment policy to route requests to a staging distribution, validate the changes, and then promote them. For details, refer to the CloudFront documentation.\nValidating IPv6 connectivity to the origin Use metrics or application logs to validate IPv6 traffic at the origin. In this example, we used an Application Load Balancer (ALB) as the origin and validated using the IPv6 Request Count metric.\nConclusion As IPv6 adoption continues to increase across mobile and global networks, enabling end-to-end IPv6—from end users to Amazon CloudFront to your origin—unlocks performance and architectural advantages that IPv4 cannot match. It eliminates NAT costs, improves routing visibility and flow control, and streamlines packet processing through fixed headers and reliable Path MTU Discovery. While CloudFront optimizes for both IPv4 and IPv6, the benefits of IPv6 are most pronounced in the first and last mile of content delivery. Adopting end-to-end IPv6 lays the foundation for scalable, high-performance, future-ready content delivery.\nEnabling full IPv6 support on Amazon CloudFront is no longer optional—it is a fundamental step toward unlocking lower latency, higher resiliency, and future scalability. If you haven’t already, enable IPv6 support in your CloudFront distribution today.\nSagar Desarda\nSagar Desarda is the Head of Technical Account Management (TAM) and Business Development (BD) for Data, Analytics, and GenAI ISVs.

Being involved in an actual project helped me better understand how a team operates in a corporate setting. However, as a student without prior cloud background, the initial adaptation phase was quite challenging.\n2. Support from Mentor / Admin Team\nThe mentor was supportive and explained concepts clearly whenever I encountered difficulties. However, since I was completely new to cloud technologies, I would have benefited from additional hands-on guidance, especially in the early stages, to reduce confusion and provide clearer direction.\n3. Alignment Between Tasks and Academic Background\nMy major is Artificial Intelligence, so I had little exposure to cloud computing before joining the program. Some parts of the workload and technical content felt advanced compared to my academic foundation. Adjusting the curriculum to better match each student’s background would improve the overall learning experience.\n4. Learning Opportunities \u0026amp; Skill Development\nI gained new knowledge and had the opportunity to participate in a real project. However, for interns who are just starting, having more direct instructions or clearer initial orientation would make the learning process smoother and more efficient.\n5. Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit\nThe team demonstrated strong collaboration and was supportive throughout the program. This positive working culture helped me integrate quickly, even though I was new to cloud technologies.\n6. Policies / Benefits for Interns\nThe program provided adequate learning resources and created favorable conditions for skill development. However, communication channels could be organized more clearly to ensure important updates are not missed.\nAdditional Questions • What I was most satisfied with:\nExperiencing a new working environment and being able to contribute to a real project from the beginning.\n• What the company should improve for future interns:\nProvide more structured and accessible learning content, especially for students unfamiliar with cloud technologies.\n• Would I recommend this internship to friends:\nYes — if the opportunity aligns with their field of study and professional goals.\nSuggestions \u0026amp; Expectations Increase the number of hands-on guidance sessions to help new interns better understand their tasks and reduce confusion during the onboarding phase. Structure communication channels more clearly, such as: One group for general discussions and Q\u0026amp;A One dedicated group for important announcements from mentors Adapt the training content to better fit each academic major, allowing interns to learn and apply knowledge more effectively.

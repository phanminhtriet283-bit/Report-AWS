	"content": "Building Resilience by Design: Developing Effective Recovery Strategies Against Ransomware Ransomware incidents have become a priority topic in leadership discussions across modern organizations. Data shows a clear trend: the number of ransomware events has more than doubled since the beginning of the pandemic, with the financial services sector being one of the most heavily targeted. At AWS, our cross-industry collaboration with global financial institutions, regulators, operational bodies, and ecosystem partners has resulted in a certified architecture for the Cloud Hosted Data Vault (CHDV)—commonly referred to simply as a vault.\nA vault is a critical component in strengthening operational resilience against large-scale cyber incidents. It acts as a fully isolated final line of defense, protecting the most mission-critical digital assets of an organization. It allows the business to recover even when traditional mechanisms such as High Availability (HA), Business Continuity (BC), Disaster Recovery (DR), or backups can no longer guarantee recovery. Integrating a vault into your existing resilience practices requires careful planning across multiple dimensions. In this article, we explore the key considerations for planning a vault, how it enhances existing HA, BC/DR, and backup strategies, and the people, process, and operational elements required for an effective cyber vaulting solution.\n1. What Should Go Into the Vault? Every business unit owner might instinctively say that “everything, everywhere” needs protection. In reality, that’s not true — at least not immediately. During a large-scale cyber incident, it is easy to fall into the mindset that every dataset, application, and service is mission-critical and must be vaulted. While it is tempting to assume that anything running in the production environment is essential, attempting to vault everything without an initial assessment can lead to:\nmassive vault sizes excessive costs recovery delays During a real cyber crisis, you must ask:\nWhich core IT functions and operational services are necessary to restart the business within the next 12, 24, or 48 hours — and which ones are not?\nThese core services are called the Minimum Viable Business (MVB) — the minimum foundation required for business survival. They include not only customer-facing services but also dependencies across second-, third-, and fourth-party ecosystems.\nFigure 1: What belongs in the vault? – Focus on core IT functions and essential operational services.\nIdentifying the MVB cannot be done in isolation. A vault is not just a technical solution — it requires collaboration across:\nIT Security Legal Business unit owners Application owners Senior leadership 2. What Will Recovery Look Like? Modern cyberattacks are intentionally designed to make system or service recovery as difficult—or nearly impossible—as possible. They aim to break traditional recovery mechanisms such as HA, BC, DR, and Backup.\nBecause attackers want maximum disruption with minimal recoverability, organizations must prepare for several critical elements:\nDecision Time Objective (DTO) How long does it take to decide to initiate recovery from the vault?\nIn a cyber incident, automated recovery workflows may no longer be trustworthy because adversaries may have tampered with them. Therefore, human decision-making becomes essential.\nCyber-Recovery Time Objective (C-RTO) \u0026amp; Cyber-Recovery Point Objective (C-RPO) Recovery timelines must be recalibrated.\nProcesses that normally take seconds may take days during a cyber event.\nMinimum Acceptable Service Offering (MASO) MASO asks:\n“What is the minimum level of service we can still offer customers and third-party partners during recovery?”\nThis may involve:\nlimited functionality of the primary service a temporary fallback system alternative access mechanisms Figure 2: What recovery looks like – What normally takes seconds may take days during a cyber crisis.\n3. How Will the Vault Be Segmented? Whether you use a single enterprise-wide vault or multiple vaults per service, the goal is always to balance:\nmanageability practicality security Core vault-design principles include:\n✔ Simplicity The vault must be easy to understand and operate.\nComplexity delays recovery.\n✔ Independence Each vault should function autonomously, enabling parallel recovery.\n✔ Service mapping Determine where recovery begins and the optimal restoration sequence.\n✔ Roles \u0026amp; responsibilities Clearly define ownership for:\napplications infrastructure recovery workflows ✔ Maintenance A vault is not static: applications and business needs evolve, and so must the vault.\nFigure 3: How the vault is segmented – Balancing manageability, content, and recovery workflows.\nAWS provides the flexibility to experiment, fail fast, and iterate without building up technical debt. What seems perfect on paper may fail in testing — and those lessons shape the next vault design.\n4. How Should the Vault Be Managed? A vault must be isolated from the operational plane so that any expanding cyber incident in production cannot cross into the vault. Without this separation, the vault itself might be compromised.\nTraditional air-gapped solutions rely on physical isolation (e.g., unplugging cables, removing media), creating a literal gap.\nIn the cloud, equivalent controls are implemented using:\nAccess zones: ephemeral environments with limited access windows Strong MFA: hardware security tokens for vault operators Zero Trust: authenticate every step; trust nothing by default IAM controls: enforce strict least-privilege boundaries Change management: access only via formal approval workflows Figure 4: How the vault is managed – Intentional isolation while preserving observability.\n5. How Should You Plan for Logistics and Service Providers? Physical considerations are often overlooked when planning for cyber recovery. When focusing heavily on core applications and infrastructure, organizations frequently neglect external dependencies that are critical to restoration.\nKey examples include:\n• Internal and external network access Even minor connectivity disruptions can halt recovery.\n• Software repositories Despite automation, organizations should maintain physical media (e.g., secure USB drives) for emergency distribution.\n• Supply chain resilience Replace destroyed hardware through pre-planned logistics:\nsourcing transport storage deployment • Physical logistics Where will teams work during a large-scale recovery?\nIs there backup equipment and workspace available?\nFigure 5: Logistics and service providers – Extending planning to external dependencies.\nSophisticated ransomware attacks often create multiple minor failures simultaneously. Individually, these failures may seem insignificant — but together, they can create cascading disruptions that dramatically slow recovery.\n6. Who Is Responsible for the Vaulting Process? People are ultimately responsible for managing and operating the cyber vaulting process. They develop best practices and serve as the first responders during recovery. Choosing the right team is crucial — and not always simple.\nVaulting principles span protection, planning, and operations.\nTherefore, effective vault governance requires collaboration across multiple stakeholders, not just a single technical group.\n• Business stakeholders They — not the backup team — should determine recovery prioritization.\nThis is based on their knowledge of:\nsystem dependencies regulatory obligations business impact Clear communication between technical and business teams is essential for an effective cyber recovery strategy.\nFigure 6: People and processes – Balancing both is fundamental for good practices.\nAs a result of cross-functional collaboration, organizations form detailed recovery plans that must be followed. However, this can inadvertently create recovery scenarios that, while aligned with policy, are not operationally realistic.\nOverly complex procedures can:\nslow recovery cause misalignment encourage operators to take shortcuts Although these behaviors may not immediately compromise security, the worst time to discover gaps in your vaulting process is during an actual cyber incident.\nFor effective recovery, organizations must embed good practices into daily operations. This requires a balance between:\nrobust cyber recovery requirements practical and sustainable operational workflows 7. Why Is Executive Sponsorship Necessary? Any additional operational burden increases cost, effort, and complexity. Naturally, executives — especially CFOs — question why a solution that does not generate revenue should consume time and budget.\nA vault is not part of daily business operations.\nTherefore, its value and purpose must be clearly understood and supported at the highest levels of the organization.\nThis requires:\n⭐ Top-down executive sponsorship Without leadership support, vault initiatives often stagnate, lack funding, or fail to gain organizational adoption.\nFigure 7: Executive sponsorship – A top-down approach aligns the entire organization.\nGetting Started with AWS AWS provides multiple layers of defense against ransomware.\n✔ Storage \u0026amp; Backup AWS Backup — centralized management, immutable backups, logical air-gapping Amazon S3 — versioning + Object Lock Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP — tamper-proof snapshots ✔ Threat Detection Amazon GuardDuty — suspicious activity detection AWS Security Hub — unified security visibility Amazon Macie — sensitive data discovery AWS WAF \u0026amp; AWS Shield — web attack and DDoS mitigation AWS Network Firewall — network-layer protection Partner solutions like Elastio integrate with AWS Backup to verify data integrity in near real-time, enabling “clean recoveries” with minimal downtime.\n✔ Identity Protection \u0026amp; Compliance AWS IAM — least privilege access AWS Organizations — centralized policy governance AWS Config \u0026amp; AWS CloudTrail — configuration auditing + forensic analysis Conclusion Cyber incidents — especially ransomware — continue to rise.\nOrganizations must shift from defending against random failures to preparing for intentional, targeted disruptions.\nThis requires:\na clear recovery strategy detailed planning for worst-case scenarios frequent testing and validation coordinated action across the entire organization Cyber resilience goes far beyond the IT department.\nIt demands commitment from:\noperations finance business leadership engineers front-line staff True resilience becomes possible only when it becomes a shared responsibility across the entire organization, from the CEO to system administrators.\nAbout the Authors Tom Tasker Storage Solution Architect – Global Financial Services, AWS\nTom works with major global financial organizations, regulators, and partners to design secure, resilient storage architectures on AWS.\nDanny Johnston Head of Global Financial Services Storage Business Development, AWS\nDanny specializes in enterprise storage strategy and collaborates with customers and regulatory bodies to drive modernization and digital transformation initiatives.\n"

Success requires integrating AI into strategy, culture, and core capabilities. Apply product thinking to AI: measure, iterate, and scale. Data is the foundation of every AI initiative Unified, high-quality, well-governed data determines AI effectiveness. Standardize metadata, lineage, sensitivity classification, and role-based access. Treat data as a strategic asset, not just technical input. Security and responsibility enable sustainable AI Security-by-design: encryption, data domain separation, and least privilege. Control model inputs/outputs, filter content, and trace requests and decisions. Transparency, fairness, and regulatory compliance are baseline requirements for modern AI deployments. Applying at Work Launch GenAI POCs with clear objectives (content generation, knowledge search, business assistants) Standardize data catalogs, establish lineage, and role-based access policies Embed security/privacy controls directly into build and run pipelines Adopt an “AI-by-default” mindset for automatable workflows Set up an AI/ML CoE, implementation playbooks, and security checklists Train teams on prompt engineering, output evaluation, and AI ethics Build a prioritized use case backlog by value vs complexity Event Experience Attending AWS Cloud Day 2025 gave me a clear pathway to bring AI into the organization: start with trustworthy data, set explicit business value metrics, then progressively raise levels of automation. What struck me most was how leading organizations balance experimentation speed with operational discipline. I left with a practical action list and strong motivation to drive change within the team.\nBroader View of Technology and Trends Recognize the pivotal role of data – GenAI – security in strategy. See AWS’s priorities in Vietnam and the region around AI, modernization, and security. Understand the picture from strategy to operations, not just isolated technologies. Connect and Learn from Experts Hear cross-industry case studies from banking, tech, and startups. Exchange directly with architects, leaders, and practitioner communities. Expand networks for collaboration and real-world implementation sharing. New Mindset for Application Embed AI into daily workflows instead of scattered pilots. Establish a solid data foundation before “burning” budget on large models. Make security, privacy, and compliance design criteria from the start. Inspired to Innovate Embrace the spirit of “Think Big, Build Smart, Ship Secure”. Accelerate learning, controlled experimentation, and internal sharing. Commit to practical, measurable digital and AI transformation. Lessons learned AI delivers sustainable value only when tightly connected to strategy, standardized data, and disciplined security. Organizations must be flexible in experimentation yet rigorous in operations to scale without losing control. The clear path: trustworthy data → KPI-backed use cases → robust guardrails → staged automation.\nSome Photos "

	"content": "Introduction to Amazon Bedrock Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed platform that provides access to a wide range of powerful large language models (LLMs). It enables applications to interact with AI models through simple API calls without the need to deploy or manage machine learning infrastructure. Bedrock supports a variety of foundation models such as Claude, Llama, and Titan, making it suitable for tasks like text generation, question-answering, content summarization, and other AI-driven use cases. In a serverless architecture, Bedrock can be integrated directly with AWS Lambda to build lightweight, scalable, and easily maintained AI services. Workshop Overview In this workshop, you will build a simple question-and-answer service using Amazon Bedrock. When a user submits a query, a Lambda function will construct a prompt, send it to a Bedrock model, and return the generated response.\nTo support this workflow, the workshop makes use of three core components:\nLambda function – acts as the processing layer, receiving input and invoking Bedrock’s API. Amazon Bedrock Runtime – performs the inference based on the selected model. API Gateway (optional) – exposes an HTTP endpoint for external clients or users to send their questions. The high-level workflow of the system is as follows:\nA user sends a question through API Gateway. API Gateway forwards the request to the Lambda function. Lambda invokes Amazon Bedrock with the constructed prompt. Bedrock returns the generated model output. Lambda formats and returns the response to the client. The diagram below illustrates the overall architecture used in this workshop:\n"

Compiled best practices for cost and security: Avoid public buckets entirely. Use Versioning + Lifecycle Rules for recovery and cost reduction. Use S3 Storage Lens and CloudWatch Budgets to monitor and control costs. Notes: Never make the entire bucket public; use Bucket Policy to expose only specific objects. Enable Block Public Access at the account level by default. Use Versioning + Lifecycle Rules to prevent data loss and reduce cost. Use CloudFront or Amplify Hosting for HTTPS, CDN, and modern static site deployment. Monitor costs using CloudWatch and S3 Storage Lens. Delete carefully when Versioning is enabled—remove all versions and delete markers before deleting a bucket. Summary of Knowledge Gained: Operate Amazon S3 at a production level: hosting, security, cost optimization, versioning, and replication. Choose the right tool for static website hosting: Amplify (recommended), CloudFront + S3, or S3 only for simplicity.

	"content": "Dynamic Routing with Amazon VPC Route Server AWS provides the managed Amazon VPC Route Server service to help customers establish and operate dynamic routing using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).\nPreviously, to enable dynamic routing inside a VPC, you had to deploy a software-based router on Amazon EC2. Now, with Amazon VPC Route Server, you can:\nEstablish BGP peerings between Route Server and virtual network appliances Exchange routing information dynamically based on network state Automatically update VPC route tables without manual configuration Detect failures faster using Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) Perform deep traffic inspection across firewalls in Multi-AZ environments This blog walks through how Amazon VPC Route Server works, key use cases, and how to begin using dynamic routing in Amazon VPC.\nOverview of Amazon VPC Route Server A customer deploys a software appliance to process voice traffic. This appliance requires dynamic routing as well as updated routing-state information derived from BGP.\nThe appliance requires:\nDynamic routing from Route Server Bidirectional BGP sessions for liveness detection Appropriate route switching Figure 1: Dynamic routing architecture with Amazon VPC Route Server\nDynamic routing flow:\nThe Route Server establishes a BGP session with the network appliance. The appliance advertises its service routes to the Route Server. The Route Server updates the VPC route tables. The Route Server establishes a BFD session the appliance. The appliance establishes its BFD session toward the Route Server. Both sides perform network-detection procedures to maintain BGP session state. How Dynamic Routing Works in Amazon VPC Figure 2: Route exchange from Route Server into VPC route tables\nSequence:\nThe network appliance establishes a BGP session with the Route Server. Routing updates are exchanged. The Route Server updates the VPC route table. Traffic flows using the new route. When Should You Use Dynamic Routing? ✔ Automated Failover Handling Failover in cloud architectures often requires routes to change immediately when an instance, device, or Availability Zone becomes unhealthy.\nFigure 3: Failover handled through dynamic routing\n✔ Floating IP Architecture for High Availability Floating IPs maintain a stable IP address even when the backend instance changes — especially important for:\nfinancial applications trading systems real-time services Figure 4: Floating IP architecture for high uptime\n✔ Traffic Inspection Through Firewalls Commonly used for:\nDMZ environments outbound traffic filtering blocking unauthorized access Dynamic routing enables:\nrouting traffic through firewalls on demand automatic adjustment when firewalls go up/down Figure 5: Multi-AZ firewall inspection architecture\n✔ Faster Failure Detection with BFD Before BFD, failover detection could take 10–30 seconds.\nWith BFD → under 1 second.\nFigure 6: Faster failure detection using BFD\n✔ Automatic VPC Route Table Updates When routes on the appliance change → VPC route tables update automatically.\nFigure 7: Automatic route updates inside VPC\nRoute Consistency and Route Advertisement Figure 8: Route advertisement inside Route Server\nThe Route Server:\nAccepts routes from the appliance Validates allowed routes Publishes routes into the VPC route table Manages lifecycle based on BGP session state BFD and Its Role in Faster Recovery BFD allows:\nmillisecond-level failure detection faster BGP failover improved consistency for latency-sensitive workloads Figure 9: How BFD accelerates failover\nConclusion Amazon VPC Route Server offers a powerful and flexible way to run dynamic routing inside AWS. With support for:\nBGP BFD Firewall inspection Floating IP architectures Automatic route advertisement → Route Server enables the design of highly available, resilient, and easy-to-operate cloud network architectures.\nAuthors Rashid Mulji – Principal Solutions Architect, AWS\nRyan Umstead – Senior Solutions Architect, AWS\n"

	"content": "Preparation Steps Before Starting Before building your AI API using Lambda + Bedrock, you need to configure several AWS resources and permissions.\n1. Choose an AWS Region that Supports Bedrock Amazon Bedrock is available in several AWS regions.\nFor this workshop, you may choose:\nus-east-1 (N. Virginia) – commonly used in AWS documentation ap-southeast-1 (Singapore) – also supports Bedrock and works normally Just make sure the model you want to use (Claude, Llama, Mistral…) is available in that region.\n2. Create an IAM Role for Lambda Lambda needs an IAM Role to call Bedrock models and write logs to CloudWatch.\nIn this section, you will first create a custom policy, then create a role and attach the policy.\n🔹 Step 1 — Create a New Policy Open IAM Console → Policies → Create policy In the “Specify permissions” page, select the JSON tab.\nDelete all existing content and replace it with the following: { \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;bedrock:InvokeModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;logs:CreateLogGroup\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;logs:CreateLogStream\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;logs:PutLogEvents\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; } ] } Click Next, give the policy a name (e.g., lambda-bedrock) and click Create policy. 🔹 Step 2 — Create the IAM Role and Attach the Policy Go to IAM Console → Roles → Create role Select: Trusted entity type: AWS service Use case: Lambda In “Add permissions”, search for the policy you created earlier (lambda-bedrock) and select it. Name your role, for example: lambda-bedrock-role Then click Create role.\nYour Lambda execution role is now ready with the minimum permissions required to call Amazon Bedrock and write CloudWatch logs.\n3. Verify the Model Using Bedrock Playground Before writing Lambda code to call the Converse API, test the model in the AWS Console.\n🔹 Step 1 — Open the Model Catalog Open Amazon Bedrock → Model catalog 🔹 Step 2 — Choose a Model and Open Playground Pick a model such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1, or Mistral 24.07 Click Open in playground 🔹 Step 3 — Send a Test Prompt Enter a simple question to confirm the model is responding correctly in your selected region.\n🔹 Step 4 — (Optional) Check if the Model Supports the Converse API If you want to confirm whether the selected model supports Converse API, follow these steps:\nReturn to the model page in the catalog Scroll down to Code examples AWS will open an example code page. If the model supports Converse API, the example will include:\nbedrock.converse(...) Like this:\n4. Recommended (Optional) Knowledge You may find it helpful to know the following:\nBasics of AWS Lambda How to create an HTTP API with API Gateway How to view logs in CloudWatch This workshop is beginner-friendly and does not require deep AWS experience.\nIn the next step, you will create a Lambda function and write your first code snippet to call the Converse API in Amazon Bedrock.\n"

	"content": "FitAI Challenge An application that helps users lose weight through exercise challenges, integrated with AI for tracking and evaluation 1. Executive Summary FitAI Challenge is a website developed for Vietnamese users, aiming to promote fitness and exercise culture through sports challenges that incorporate gamification and artificial intelligence (AI). The website uses an AI Camera to recognize and count exercise movements such as push-ups, squats, planks, and jumping jacks, while also analyzing posture to provide accurate evaluations. Users can participate in individual challenges to earn FitPoints upon completing tasks, which can be redeemed for vouchers, gifts, or discounts from partner merchants. FitAI Challenge targets students, young adults, and working professionals — individuals who need motivation to maintain regular workout habits amid their busy lives.\n2. Problem Statement What’s the Problem? In Vietnam, most existing fitness applications primarily focus on basic guidance or step counting, and there is currently no platform that combines AI-based motion recognition, gamification, and an online fitness challenge community. Users often lack motivation to exercise consistently and do not have tools that can accurately evaluate their workout performance. In addition, gyms and sports brands also lack creative engagement channels to connect with young and active customer groups.\nThe Solution FitAI Challenge uses an AI Camera to recognize, count, and evaluate the accuracy of workout movements through Computer Vision. All user workout data is stored and processed via AWS Cloud using a serverless architecture: AWS Lambda: processes AI data and backend requests. AWS S3: stores videos, images, and temporary results. The website is developed using React Native with a friendly and intuitive interface. Users can: Participate in individual, group, or nationwide challenges. Earn FitPoints upon completing exercises. Redeem FitPoints for vouchers or gifts from partners (Shopee, Grab, CGV, etc.). Track leaderboards and share achievements on social media.\nBenefits and Return on Investment For users: Create daily workout motivation through challenge and reward mechanisms. Receive transparent performance evaluations supported by AI. Connect with the fitness community through leaderboards and sharing feeds. For partner businesses: A branding channel associated with a healthy lifestyle. Access to a young, dynamic, and health-conscious customer base. For the development team: Establish a unique “Fitness + Gamification + E-commerce” business model in Vietnam. Serverless cloud architecture helps reduce operating costs and allows easy scalability. The MVP can be developed within the first 3 months with low infrastructure costs (estimated at 0.80 USD/month on AWS).\n3. Solution Architecture FitAI Challenge is an intelligent sports training platform that applies an AWS Serverless architecture combined with an AI/ML pipeline. The system’s goal is to record workout data, analyze performance, and generate AI-powered feedback to provide personalized coaching for users. Data from the web application is sent to Amazon API Gateway, processed by AWS Lambda (Java), and stored in Amazon S3 along with the Docker Database.\nAWS Services Used Service Role Amazon Route 53 Manages domain names and routes traffic to CloudFront. AWS WAF Protects frontend and API layers from DDoS and OWASP attacks. Amazon CloudFront Delivers static content (web app built from Java web, HTML, CSS, JS). Amazon API Gateway Receives requests from the frontend and forwards them to Lambda functions. AWS Lambda (Java) Handles business logic (registration, login, data upload, scoring, AI pipeline). AWS Step Functions \u0026amp; SQS Coordinates workflows between Lambda and SageMaker/Bedrock. Amazon Cognito Authenticates users, manages login sessions, and controls access permissions. Amazon S3 Stores raw data, videos, images, and analysis results. Docker Runs the Java Spring Boot API backend and hosts the database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB). Amazon SageMaker Runs inference for computer vision/pose estimation models. Amazon Bedrock Generates natural language feedback, training suggestions, and summary reports. Amazon SES Sends authentication emails and user result notifications. Amazon CloudWatch Monitors logs, Lambda performance, costs, and system efficiency. IAM Manages access permissions and security across services. AWS CodePipeline / CodeBuild / CodeDeploy CI/CD pipeline for automating Java backend and Lambda deployment. Component Design Frontend Layer: The web app displays the user interface and connects to the API Gateway. The content is built and deployed on S3 + CloudFront. Users access the system through Route 53 → WAF → CloudFront → API Gateway. Application Layer: The API Gateway receives requests from the frontend. Lambda (Java) executes business functions: AuthLambda: handles user login and authentication. UploadLambda: receives workout data, images, or videos. AIPipelineLambda: triggers the AI workflow (SageMaker + Bedrock). SaveResultLambda: stores training results and AI feedback.\n4. Technical Implementation Implementation Phases\nPhase Description Achieved Outcome 1. AWS Infrastructure Setup Deploy VPC, Private Subnets, Route 53, WAF, S3, API Gateway, Lambda, Cognito, RDS MySQL, VPC Endpoints (S3, Bedrock). Secure, isolated, and ready-to-use base infrastructure. 2. CI/CD Pipeline Set up CodeCommit + CodeBuild + CodeDeploy + CodePipeline for Java backend and Lambda; build \u0026amp; deploy web to S3/CloudFront. Automated deployment for backend and frontend. 3. Build Lambda Functions (Java) Create Lambdas for Auth, Upload, AI Pipeline, Save Result; connect to RDS MySQL and S3. Completed serverless backend. 4. AI Pipeline Integrate SQS, Step Functions, and Bedrock; build workflow: receive job → analyze data → score → generate AI feedback. Smooth AI operation with automated user feedback. 5. Web App Deployment Build web app → Deploy to S3 + CloudFront → configure domain in Route 53. Stable online user interface. 6. Monitoring \u0026amp; Cost Optimization Use CloudWatch + Cost Explorer to track logs, performance, and costs; tune Lambda, RDS, and CloudFront configurations. Stable system with low cost and tight monitoring. 5. Timeline \u0026amp; Milestones Before internship (Month 0):\nDesign detailed architecture based on the new diagram.\nExperiment with a simple AI pipeline using Bedrock (text feedback).\nInternship (Months 1–3):\nMonth 1:\nSet up infrastructure: VPC, Subnets, RDS MySQL, Cognito, API Gateway, Lambda, S3, CloudFront.\nConfigure CI/CD (CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline).\nMonth 2:\nDevelop Java backend and Lambda functions.\nBuild the AI pipeline with SQS, Step Functions, and Bedrock.\nMonth 3:\nIntegrate frontend with backend.\nRun performance tests, pilot with 10–20 users, prepare the final demo.\nPost-deployment:\nContinue optimizing the AI model and add deeper gamification over the next year.\n6. Budget Estimation You can view costs on the AWS Pricing Calculator, or download the attached budget estimate.\nInfrastructure Costs (MVP estimate)\nAWS Services: Amazon API Gateway: 0.38 USD / month (≈300 requests/month, 1 KB/request). Amazon Bedrock: 0.32 USD / month (1 req/min, 350 input tokens, 70 output tokens). Amazon CloudFront: 1.20 USD / month (5 GB transfer, 500,000 HTTPS requests). Amazon CloudWatch: 1.85 USD / month (5 metrics, 0.5 GB logs). Amazon Cognito: 0.00 USD / month (≤100 MAU). Amazon Route 53: 0.51 USD / month (1 hosted zone). Amazon S3: 0.04 USD / month (1 GB storage, 1,000 PUT/POST/LIST, 20,000 GET). Amazon SES: 0.30 USD / month (3,000 emails from EC2/Lambda). Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS): ≈0.00 USD / month (0.005 million requests/month). AWS Lambda: 0.00 USD / month (≈300,000 requests/month, 512 MB ephemeral storage). AWS Step Functions: 0.00 USD / month (500 workflows, 5 state transitions/workflow). AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF): 6.12 USD / month (1 Web ACL, 1 rule). Amazon RDS MySQL (auto-stop mode): 0–3 USD / month (depending on runtime). Total: around 10.7 – 12 USD / month depending on RDS usage; equivalent to 128 – 144 USD / 12 months.\n7. Risk Assessment Risk Matrix\nTechnical: AI misidentifies movements or fails on image/video processing; misconfigured VPC/Endpoints cause service disruption. User: Users don’t maintain workout habits; low return rate. Market \u0026amp; Partners: Hard to expand reward partners and co-branding; partner policy changes. Cost: Unexpected cost increases when user volume spikes (CloudFront, Bedrock). Mitigation Strategies\nOptimize AI models with continuous training; monitor quality via logs; add basic validation before scoring. Deepen gamification (streak chains, friend groups, seasonal challenges, appealing rewards). Prepare clear value propositions; diversify partner types (sports, healthy food, entertainment). Set AWS Budgets + Alarms per service (CloudFront, Bedrock, Lambda, RDS). Contingency Plans\nIf AI fails → use fallback logic (simple time/rep-based scoring) and clearly notify users. If user volume drops → launch community challenges, pair with social media campaigns. If commercial partners withdraw → maintain internal FitPoints with small rewards (in-app badges/vouchers) while finding new partners. 8. Expected Outcomes Technical Improvements:\nComplete the AI motion recognition system with \u0026gt;90% accuracy. Stable app that supports up to 10,000 concurrent active users on serverless architecture. Optimize architecture to keep infra cost around 10–12 USD/month in the early stage. Long-term Value:\nBuild a sustainable Vietnamese fitness community connected via online challenges. Become the pioneering “AI + Fitness + Gamification” platform in Vietnam. Establish a workout data foundation to expand into health analytics, personalized training programs, and future AI projects. "

	"content": "Overall Evaluation 1. Working Environment\nThe working environment was new, professional, and provided me with opportunities to observe real-world workflows. Being involved in an actual project helped me better understand how a team operates in a corporate setting. However, as a student without prior cloud background, the initial adaptation phase was quite challenging.\n2. Support from Mentor / Admin Team\nThe mentor was supportive and explained concepts clearly whenever I encountered difficulties. However, since I was completely new to cloud technologies, I would have benefited from additional hands-on guidance, especially in the early stages, to reduce confusion and provide clearer direction.\n3. Alignment Between Tasks and Academic Background\nMy major is Artificial Intelligence, so I had little exposure to cloud computing before joining the program. Some parts of the workload and technical content felt advanced compared to my academic foundation. Adjusting the curriculum to better match each student’s background would improve the overall learning experience.\n4. Learning Opportunities \u0026amp; Skill Development\nI gained new knowledge and had the opportunity to participate in a real project. However, for interns who are just starting, having more direct instructions or clearer initial orientation would make the learning process smoother and more efficient.\n5. Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit\nThe team demonstrated strong collaboration and was supportive throughout the program. This positive working culture helped me integrate quickly, even though I was new to cloud technologies.\n6. Policies / Benefits for Interns\nThe program provided adequate learning resources and created favorable conditions for skill development. However, communication channels could be organized more clearly to ensure important updates are not missed.\nAdditional Questions • What I was most satisfied with:\nExperiencing a new working environment and being able to contribute to a real project from the beginning.\n• What the company should improve for future interns:\nProvide more structured and accessible learning content, especially for students unfamiliar with cloud technologies.\n• Would I recommend this internship to friends:\nYes — if the opportunity aligns with their field of study and professional goals.\nSuggestions \u0026amp; Expectations Increase the number of hands-on guidance sessions to help new interns better understand their tasks and reduce confusion during the onboarding phase. Structure communication channels more clearly, such as: One group for general discussions and Q\u0026amp;A One dedicated group for important announcements from mentors Adapt the training content to better fit each academic major, allowing interns to learn and apply knowledge more effectively.

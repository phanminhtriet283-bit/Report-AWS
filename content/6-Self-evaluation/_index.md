During my internship at Amazon Web Services Vietnam Co., Ltd. from August 12, 2025 to December 9, 2025, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge I had acquired at university in a real working environment.  
I participated in the FitAI Challenge project, through which I developed various skills such as self-directed research, requirement analysis, report writing, team communication, problem-solving, and applying new technologies.

In terms of work ethic, I consistently strived to complete assigned tasks, adhere to company regulations, and actively collaborate with colleagues to improve work efficiency.

### Needs Improvement
* Although I have followed company regulations and workflows well, there is still room to improve discipline**, especially in time management, task planning, and maintaining consistent progress.  
* Continued development of analytical and problem-solving skills is needed, including exploring multiple solution approaches and identifying the root causes of issues to determine the most suitable resolution.  
* Communication skills can be further improved by presenting problems more clearly, defining goals thoroughly from the beginning, and proactively discussing challenges to avoid delays.  
* Strengthening the ability to organize and systematize knowledge would support more effective learning and faster adaptation to new technologies.

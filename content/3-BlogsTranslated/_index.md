This section lists and briefly introduces the AWS blogs that the team has translated:

### [Blog 1 – Building Operational Resilience: Designing Effective Recovery Strategies Against Ransomware](3.1-Blog1/)
This blog focuses on how organizations can strengthen **cyber resilience** against ransomware using the **Cloud Hosted Data Vault (CHDV)** architecture. It explains key considerations when designing a vault — including identifying critical data and business functions, planning realistic recovery workflows under cyberattack scenarios, segmenting the vault environment, and applying strict access and operational controls. The blog also emphasizes the role of people, processes, and leadership sponsorship in ensuring effective cyber recovery.

### [Blog 2 – Dynamic Routing Using Amazon VPC Route Server](3.2-Blog2/)
This blog introduces how **Amazon VPC Route Server** enables dynamic routing (BGP) inside a VPC, allowing more granular traffic control and automated failover. Through scenarios such as using floating IPs for high-availability applications or directing traffic through firewall appliances, the article demonstrates how the Route Server automatically updates VPC route tables, reduces manual configuration, and increases the resiliency of cloud network architectures on AWS.

### [Blog 3 – Launch of the AWS Asia Pacific (New Zealand) Region](3.3-Blog3/)
This blog announces the official launch of the **AWS Asia Pacific (New Zealand) Region (ap-southeast-6)**. It highlights the benefits of the new region, including local data residency, lower latency for workloads serving New Zealand users, enhanced support for AI and generative AI solutions, and expanded cloud infrastructure across the country. The blog also underscores AWS’s commitments to sustainability, economic impact, workforce development, and the growth of the AWS partner and developer community in New Zealand.

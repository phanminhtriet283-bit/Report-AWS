**The Road to the Big Leagues**

As a child, Band was passionate about football and statistics. He strengthened that passion by earning a Bachelor of Science in sports management at the University of Florida, and then a Master of Science in analytics at the University of Chicago.

Beyond his academic degrees, Band’s journey took him from college athletics to the professional arena. He worked as an admissions assistant for the University of Florida football program and as a scouting assistant at the Minnesota Vikings before joining the NFL’s Next Gen Stats team—truly a dream job for fans of football statistics! But this work is more than just analyzing numbers — it’s about revolutionizing how we understand the sport.

**Making Waves at Next Gen Stats**

In his role as senior manager of research and analytics, Band has helped develop advanced AI models that are transforming the way football is analyzed. As the NFL’s proprietary player- and ball-tracking platform, Next Gen Stats is used by league officials, broadcasters, media partners, and all 32 teams — including coaches, scouts, and players.

Through his work with [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/), Band has pushed the boundaries of what’s possible in football analytics, helping turn raw data into actionable insights.

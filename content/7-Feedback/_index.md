### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment was new, professional, and provided me with opportunities to observe real-world workflows. Being involved in an actual project helped me better understand how a team operates in a corporate setting. However, as a student without prior cloud background, the initial adaptation phase was quite challenging.

**2. Support from Mentor / Admin Team**  
The mentor was supportive and explained concepts clearly whenever I encountered difficulties. However, since I was completely new to cloud technologies, I would have benefited from additional hands-on guidance, especially in the early stages, to reduce confusion and provide clearer direction.

**3. Alignment Between Tasks and Academic Background**  
My major is Artificial Intelligence, so I had little exposure to cloud computing before joining the program. Some parts of the workload and technical content felt advanced compared to my academic foundation. Adjusting the curriculum to better match each student’s background would improve the overall learning experience.

**4. Learning Opportunities & Skill Development**  
I gained new knowledge and had the opportunity to participate in a real project. However, for interns who are just starting, having more direct instructions or clearer initial orientation would make the learning process smoother and more efficient.

**5. Culture & Team Spirit**  
The team demonstrated strong collaboration and was supportive throughout the program. This positive working culture helped me integrate quickly, even though I was new to cloud technologies.

**6. Policies / Benefits for Interns**  
The program provided adequate learning resources and created favorable conditions for skill development. However, communication channels could be organized more clearly to ensure important updates are not missed.

### Suggestions & Expectations

* Increase the number of hands-on guidance sessions to help new interns better understand their tasks and reduce confusion during the onboarding phase.  
* Structure communication channels more clearly, such as:  
  - One group for general discussions and Q&A  
  - One dedicated group for important announcements from mentors  
* Adapt the training content to better fit each academic major, allowing interns to learn and apply knowledge more effectively.

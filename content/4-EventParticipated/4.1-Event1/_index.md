### Key Highlights

#### Morning Panel: Navigating the GenAI Revolution

- Build organizational capability to absorb AI: data, processes, people
- Start small, measure clearly, iterate fast, and scale with control
- Change management: leadership roles, internal communication, and AI ethics framework
- Define KPI/OKR for AI use cases to track ROI and tangible value
- Establish guardrails to mitigate risks: model bias, data leakage, and output misuse

#### Track 1: Gen AI and Data

- Build a unified “data foundation”: quality, lineage, governance, and security
- GenAI on AWS roadmap: from data readiness to model operations
- AI across the software development lifecycle: from requirements to testing
- Design guardrails and least-privilege access control
- Construct knowledge stores with vector stores, feature stores, and data cataloging
- Model observability: drift, output quality, and inference cost management
- AI/ML cost governance: model selection, context optimization, caching, and batching

#### Track 2: Migration & Modernization

- Large-scale migration lessons: insights from financial services
- Application modernization with AI-powered coding assistants and automated testing
- Transform VMware infrastructure to AWS: minimize downtime and optimize operations cost
- Security at scale: embed security end-to-end from build to run
- Path from monolith → microservices, containerization and/or serverless by domain
- IaC & policy-as-code: standardize configs, cut operational errors, enable auditing
- Automate CI/CD pipelines, regression testing, and security scans pre-release

### What I Learned

#### GenAI is the next wave of transformation

- AI reshapes how businesses build products, serve customers, and operate.
- Success requires integrating AI into strategy, culture, and core capabilities.
- Apply product thinking to AI: measure, iterate, and scale.

#### Data is the foundation of every AI initiative

- Unified, high-quality, well-governed data determines AI effectiveness.
- Standardize metadata, lineage, sensitivity classification, and role-based access.
- Treat data as a strategic asset, not just technical input.

#### Security and responsibility enable sustainable AI

- Security-by-design: encryption, data domain separation, and least privilege.
- Control model inputs/outputs, filter content, and trace requests and decisions.
- Transparency, fairness, and regulatory compliance are baseline requirements for modern AI deployments.

### Applying at Work

- Launch GenAI POCs with clear objectives (content generation, knowledge search, business assistants)
- Standardize data catalogs, establish lineage, and role-based access policies
- Embed security/privacy controls directly into build and run pipelines
- Adopt an “AI-by-default” mindset for automatable workflows
- Set up an AI/ML CoE, implementation playbooks, and security checklists
- Train teams on prompt engineering, output evaluation, and AI ethics
- Build a prioritized use case backlog by value vs complexity

### Event Experience

Attending **AWS Cloud Day 2025** gave me a clear pathway to bring AI into the organization: start with trustworthy data, set explicit business value metrics, then progressively raise levels of automation. What struck me most was how leading organizations balance experimentation speed with operational discipline. I left with a practical action list and strong motivation to drive change within the team.

#### Broader View of Technology and Trends

- Recognize the pivotal role of data – GenAI – security in strategy.
- See AWS’s priorities in Vietnam and the region around AI, modernization, and security.
- Understand the picture from strategy to operations, not just isolated technologies.

#### Connect and Learn from Experts

- Hear cross-industry case studies from banking, tech, and startups.
- Exchange directly with architects, leaders, and practitioner communities.
- Expand networks for collaboration and real-world implementation sharing.

#### New Mindset for Application

- Embed AI into daily workflows instead of scattered pilots.
- Establish a solid data foundation before “burning” budget on large models.
- Make security, privacy, and compliance design criteria from the start.

#### Inspired to Innovate

- Embrace the spirit of “Think Big, Build Smart, Ship Secure”.
- Accelerate learning, controlled experimentation, and internal sharing.
- Commit to practical, measurable digital and AI transformation.

#### Lessons learned

AI delivers sustainable value only when tightly connected to strategy, standardized data, and disciplined security. Organizations must be flexible in experimentation yet rigorous in operations to scale without losing control. The clear path: trustworthy data → KPI-backed use cases → robust guardrails → staged automation.

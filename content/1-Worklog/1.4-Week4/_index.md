###  Week 4 Achievements:

* Fully understood the difference between **Access Key/Secret Key** and **IAM Role**, and why IAM Roles are more secure.  
* Learned how to **create and configure IAM Roles** with proper permissions (e.g., read/write access to S3).  
* Successfully attached **IAM Roles** to EC2 instances and accessed AWS services securely.  
* Became familiar with **AWS Cloud9 IDE**:  
  * Created and configured development environments.  
  * Connected to EC2 instance.  
  * Executed AWS CLI commands and tested sample code directly in the IDE.  
* Built and deployed a simple Node.js application on Cloud9 to interact with AWS S3 and DynamoDB.  
* Practiced **resource cleanup** after workshops to avoid unnecessary billing.
